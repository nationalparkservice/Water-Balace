# NPS Water-Balance
This is the National Park Service Water Balance github Repository.  It is intended to be a workplace for sharing and version tracking of NPS derived water balance related tools.  

As of January 24th, 2022 this includes an excel tool for deriving point scale daily water balance variables (see: https://github.com/nationalparkservice/Water-Balance/tree/ExcelPointWaterBalance), and a python script for GIS based continuous monthly water balance variables (see: https://github.com/nationalparkservice/Water-Balance/tree/PythonMonthlyWaterBalance). 

The repository is a work in progress and we welcome the NPS community to add Water Balance tools to the repository.
