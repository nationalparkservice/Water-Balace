# Python Based Monthly Water-Balance Scripts

Python code for deriving gridded based monthly water balance products following logic defined in Lutz et. al 2010 and Dilts et. al 2015 Journal of Biogreography articles. Script has been modified to process successive years of data (i.e. water balance across numerous years (e.g. 2000, 2001, 2002, ...).  There is the option to derive water balance using evaptransporation either using a 'Penman-Monteith' (Physically Based) or 'Hamon' (Emperically Based) calculation.
